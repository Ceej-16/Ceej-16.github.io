   This is my first blog post! 
   
   I'm using Jekyll and GitHub Pages to build my blog.

### Method 2: Using File Explorer (Alternative)

If Obsidian is giving you trouble with file extensions:

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to your vault folder
3. Create the folder and files directly
4. Edit them in Notepad or any text editor

### After Creating the Files

Your vault structure should look like this:
```
blog-vault/
├── .obsidian/          (Obsidian's folder - created automatically)
├── _posts/
│   └── 2025-02-11-my-first-post.md
├── _config.yml
├── index.md
└── .gitignore
